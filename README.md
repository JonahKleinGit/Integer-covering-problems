In this repository, you can find a collection of algorithms used to solve integer covering problems. 

minlcm.py contains the code necessary to check whether there exists a covering system with a given minimum modulus and a given lcm

5to105.py contain the code necessary to verify that there does not exists a distinct covering system with moduli in the interval [5,107]
